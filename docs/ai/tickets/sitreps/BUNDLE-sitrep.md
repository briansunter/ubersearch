## Outcome
CLI correctly uses SearXNG when no config exists. Found 10 total results: 9 from "brave" backend, 1 from "wikipedia" backend. The "brave" engine ID in results is from SearXNG's backend (expected behavior - SearXNG is a meta-search engine that aggregates from multiple backends). Engine Status section confirms "searchxng ✓ Success".
